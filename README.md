## Remember
<p> This was a project that I presented as a final project in one of the semesters of my technological degree. <br>
But it is not finished yet due to errors, logic, and reading of files where data is saved. </p>

## About this proyect
<p>
This system aims to help the organization of local gyms for the inhabitants of a city, <br>where they did not have this system to organize their clients, along with assistance and training plans.
